## Machine Learning for Single-Cell Biology

In the past years, machine learning has started to help understand the molecular biology of single cells. Within this context, we develop methods that target specific biological questions, hence originate from many different areas of machine learning: deep learning [[P20](/publications#P20), [P27](/publications#P27)], topological data analysis [[P25](/publications#P25)], manifold learning [[P19](/publications#P19)], and causal inference [[T20](../talks/#T20)]. With [F. J. Theis](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=sqWpn2AAAAAJ).

We show that generative models predict single-cell perturbation effects out-of-sample [[P27](/publications#P27), [code](https://github.com/theislab/scgen)]. This enables training models to predict the effects of disease and disease treatment on humans, by training models on unperturbed data from human together with data that has seen perturbations for other species.

[Scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io) [[P23](/publications#P23), [code](https://github.com/theislab/scanpy)] is a scalable toolkit for analyzing single-cell gene expression data. It includes preprocessing, visualization, clustering, trajectory inference and differential expression testing.

PAGA generates coarse-grained maps of manifolds with complex topologies - efficiently and robustly across different datasets.

We won the [7th prize](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2017/leaderboard) among [nearly 2400 teams](https://datasciencebowl.com/about/); the best result among all  German teams [[code](https://github.com/NDKoehler/DataScienceBowl2017_7th_place)].

[Tensor Trains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_product_state) ([MPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_product_state), [DMRG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_matrix_renormalization_group)) rank, with [quantum Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Monte_Carlo) and the [Numerical Renormalization Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_renormalization_group), among the most popular numerical approaches for tackling the exponential [computational complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability) of models of [strongly correlated materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_correlated_material). Being a topic in applied Mathematics since a few years, they have recently appeared within Machine Learning. I developed a way to use Tensor Trains within [Dynamical Mean-Field Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_mean-field_theory) to improve our ability of simulating strongly correlated materials [[O6](/publications#O6),[P12-P18](/publications#P18)]. With [U. Schollw√∂ck](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=MYARbMAAAAAJ&hl=en).

Before that, I modeled diffusion-reaction processes to enhance material properties of solar cells [[O5](/publications#O5),[P8-P11](/publications#P11)]. With [P. Pichler](https://www.google.de/search?q=intrinsic+point+defects%2C+impurities+and+their+diffusion+in+silicon). Also, I investigated the [quantum Rabi model](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v4/68), which is, for example, important for understanding technical foundations of quantum computing [[P6,P7](/publications#P7)]. With [D. Braak](https://www.google.de/search?q=Integrability+of+the+Rabi+Model).

During studies, I focused on emergent properties of quantum-many body systems and their applications, for example, in showing how [grain boundaries](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nphys1739) limit [high-temperature superconductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-temperature_superconductivity) [[P5](/publications#P5)]. With [T. Kopp](https://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/exp6/staff/kopp_t/). Also, I did research on the non-equilibrium behavior of these systems [[P1-P4](/publications#P4)], in particular, the fundamental problem of how such systems transition from an excited state to equilibrium. This happens through chaotic dynamics in the classical case, but is an active area of research in the [quantum case](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature06838). We showed that the transition proceeds through an intermediate, prethermalized, plateau for which a statistical theory applies - [M. Kollar](http://myweb.rz.uni-augsburg.de/~mkollar/) posed this as a problem for a summer project, during which I contributed the central analytical calculation [[T1](../talks/#T1)] to the highly cited paper [[P3](/publications#P3)]. With [M. Rigol](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MeS-yJgAAAAJ), I investigated *collapse and revival oscillations* and *coherent expansions*, as suggested for realizing matter-wave lasers [[P2,P4](/publications#P4)].

During high school, I tried to gain a better understanding of how philosophical and political ideas stimulate change in society and culture. My thesis  investigated why J.-P. Sartre publicly supported the German terrorist group RAF upon his visit in Stammheim in 1974 [[O1](/publications#O1)]. <!-- [article](http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-90848693.html). -->
