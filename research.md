Title: Research

In the past years, machine learning has started to help map, understand and predict the molecular biology of single cells. We develop methods that address specific biological hypotheses and originate from different areas of machine learning. With [F. J. Theis](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=sqWpn2AAAAAJ).

Prior to joining machine learning for biology, I developed computational techniques for predicting the emergent behavior in models of strongly correlated quantum materials, quantum computers, and chemical reactions in solar cells.

## Generative models predict single-cell perturbation effects

Using a model called scGen, we demonstrated that generative models predict single-cell perturbation effects out-of-sample [[P27](/publications#P27)]. The approach enables training models to predict the effects of disease and disease treatment across cell types and species. While the first implementation of scGen relied on latent space vector arithmetics, we recently published an end-to-end-trained model based on a conditional variational autoencoder: transformer VAE [[P28](/publications#P28)].

## Mapping the coarse-grained connectivity structure of complex manifolds

[<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D2FmvihWkAA9wmG?format=jpg&name=medium" title="Hematopoietic lineages as captured in scRNA-seq from Paul et al., Cell (2015). See [P26]." style="width: 250px; margin: 15px 10px 5px 0px"  align="left">](/publications#P24)
Partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA) reconciles clustering with manifold learning by explaining variation using both discrete and continuous latent variables [[P26](/publications#P26)]. PAGA generates coarse-grained maps of manifolds with complex topologies in a computationally highly efficient and robust way. In [[P24](/publications#P24)], we used it to infer the first lineage tree of a whole complex animal - a [Science breakthrough](https://vis.sciencemag.org/breakthrough2018/) of the year 2018. It has been benchmarked as the overall best performing trajectory inference method in a review of ~70 methods by [Saelens *et al.* (Nat. Biotechn., 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0071-9), [tweet)](https://twitter.com/falexwolf/status/1113002674209873920).

## Tensor trains and dynamical mean-field theory

*Emergent properties of materials through computational many-body physics at the interface of quantum information and field theory.*

[<img src="../img/wolf12.png" title="Time evolution of photon excitation through entanglement with a quantum bit. From [P6]." style="width: 100px; margin: 15px 10px 5px 0px"  align="left">](/publications#P6)
[Tensor Trains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_product_state) ([MPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_product_state), [DMRG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_matrix_renormalization_group)) constitute, together with [quantum monte carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Monte_Carlo) and the [numerical renormalization group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_renormalization_group), the key numerical approaches for tackling the exponential [computational complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability) of models of [strongly correlated materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_correlated_material) and quantum computers.

We developed a way to use Tensor Trains within [Dynamical Mean-Field Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_mean-field_theory) to improve the ability of simulating strongly correlated materials [[O6](/publications#O6),[P12-P18](/publications#P18)]. With [U. Schollw√∂ck](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=MYARbMAAAAAJ&hl=en) and [A. Millis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZVaMoP0AAAAJ&hl=en) (Columbia U, Flatiron Institute, funded through [Materials Genome Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/mgi)). Meanwhile, tensor trains have been a topic in applied mathematics and also appeared in machine learning.

## Diffusion-reaction chemistry of solar cells

*Improving low solar energy conversion efficiencies through modeling.*

The low energy conversion efficiency of established solar cells is largely due to chemical imperfections of the material at which excited photons recombine. While at Bosch research, I established models for material syntheses to optimize processes for the minimization of such imperfections [[O5](/publications#O5),[P8-P11](/publications#P11)]. Mathematically, these models reduce to diffusion-reaction equations. I wrote a proprietary software for doing so which was productionized for Bosch Solar Energy. With [P. Pichler](https://www.google.de/search?q=intrinsic+point+defects%2C+impurities+and+their+diffusion+in+silicon).

## Dynamics of the quantum Rabi model

*The dynamics of a Q-bit coupled to a decoherence-generating bath.*

The [quantum Rabi model](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v4/68) is the basic model for understanding decoherence of a Q-bit that is coupled to a bath, and hence, a basic model for the technical foundations of quantum computing [[P6,P7](/publications#P7)]. By exploiting a recent exact solution of the static system, we established several dynamical properties, amonth others, Schroedinger-cat like states that show particular robustness towards decoherence. With [D. Braak](https://www.google.de/search?q=Integrability+of+the+Rabi+Model).

## Basic emergent properties of quantum many-body systems in non-equilibrium

*Supercurrent, chaos, equilibriation, matter wave lasers.*

[<img src="../img/jreissaty12.png" title="Expanding cloud of coherent atoms - a 'matter laser' - in a 2d lattice. From [P4]." style="width: 100px; margin: 15px 10px 5px 0px"  align="left">](/publications#P4)
During studies, I focused on emergent properties of quantum-many body systems and their applications, for example, in showing how [grain boundaries](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nphys1739) limit [high-temperature superconductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-temperature_superconductivity) [[P5](/publications#P5)]. With [T. Kopp](https://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/exp6/staff/kopp_t/). Also, I did research on the non-equilibrium behavior of these systems [[P1-P4](/publications#P4)], in particular, the fundamental problem of how such systems transition from an excited state to equilibrium. This happens through chaotic dynamics in the classical case, but is an active area of research in the [quantum case](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature06838). We showed that the transition proceeds through an intermediate, prethermalized, plateau for which a statistical theory applies - [M. Kollar](http://myweb.rz.uni-augsburg.de/~mkollar/) posed this as a problem for a summer project, during which I contributed the central analytical calculation [[T1](../talks/#T1)] to the highly cited paper [[P3](/publications#P3)]. With [M. Rigol](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MeS-yJgAAAAJ), I investigated *collapse and revival oscillations* and *coherent expansions*, as suggested for realizing matter-wave lasers [[P2,P4](/publications#P4)].

## Sartre in Stammheim

During high school, I tried to gain a better understanding of how philosophical and political ideas stimulate change in society and culture. In my thesis, I investigated why J.-P. Sartre publicly supported the German terrorist group RAF upon his visit in Stammheim in 1974 [[O1](/publications#O1), for more, see [Der Spiegel (2013)](http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-90848693.html)].
