  Abstract                 = {We present a new impurity solver for dynamical mean-field theory based on imaginary-time evolution of matrix product states. This converges the self-consistency loop on the imaginary-frequency axis and obtains real-frequency information in a final real-time evolution. Relative to computations on the real-frequency axis, required bath sizes are much smaller and less entanglement is generated, so much larger systems can be studied. The power of the method is demonstrated by solutions of a three band model in the single and two-site dynamical mean-field approximation. Technical issues are discussed, including details of the method, efficiency as compared to other matrix product state based impurity solvers, bath construction and its relation to real-frequency computations and the analytic continuation problem of quantum Monte Carlo, the choice of basis in dynamical cluster approximation, and perspectives for off-diagonal hybridization functions.},

  Abstract                 = {Many numerical techniques for the description of quantum systems that are coupled to a continuous bath require the discretization of the latter. To this end, a wealth of methods has been developed in the literature, which we classify as (i) direct discretization, (ii) orthogonal polynomial, and (iii) numerical optimization strategies. We recapitulate strategies (i) and (ii) to clarify their relation. For quadratic Hamiltonians, we show that (ii) is the best strategy in the sense that it gives the numerically exact time evolution up to a maximum time $t_\text{max}$, for which we give a simple expression. For non-quadratic Hamiltonians, we show that no such best strategy exists. We present numerical examples relevant to open quantum systems and strongly correlated systems, as treated by dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT).},

  Abstract                 = {We study the unitary time evolution of antiferromagnetic order in the Hubbard model after a quench starting from the perfect N\'eel state. In this setup, which is well suited for experiments with cold atoms, one can distinguish fundamentally different pathways for melting of long-range order at weak and strong interaction. In the Mott insulating regime, melting of long-range order occurs due to the ultra-fast transfer of energy from charge excitations to the spin background, while local magnetic moments and their exchange coupling persist during the process. The latter can be demonstrated by a local spin-precession experiment. At weak interaction, local moments decay along with the long-range order. The dynamics is governed by residual quasiparticles, which are reflected in oscillations of the off-diagonal components of the momentum distribution. Such oscillations provide an alternative route to study the prethermalization phenomenon and its influence on the dynamics away from the integrable (noninteracting) limit. The Hubbard model is solved within nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory, using the density matrix-renormalization group as an impurity solver.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a strictly single-site DMRG algorithm based on the subspace expansion of the Alternating Minimal Energy (AMEn) method. The proposed new MPS basis enrichment method is sufficient to avoid local minima during the optimisation, similarly to the density matrix perturbation method, but computationally cheaper. Each application of $\hat H$ to $|\Psi\rangle$ in the central eigensolver is reduced in cost for a speed-up of $\approx (d + 1)/2$, with $d$ the physical site dimension. Further speed-ups result from cheaper auxiliary calculations and an often greatly improved convergence behaviour. Runtime to convergence improves by up to a factor of 2.5 on the Fermi-Hubbard model compared to the previous single-site method and by up to a factor of 3.9 compared to two-site DMRG. The method is compatible with real-space parallelisation and non-abelian symmetries.},

  Abstract                 = {We link linear prediction of Chebyshev and Fourier expansions to analytic continuation. We push the resolution in the Chebyshev-based computation of $T=0$ many-body spectral functions to a much higher precision by deriving a modified Chebyshev series expansion that allows to reduce the expansion order by a factor $\sim\frac{1}{6}$. We show that in a certain limit the Chebyshev technique becomes equivalent to computing spectral functions via time evolution and subsequent Fourier transform. This introduces a novel recursive time evolution algorithm that instead of the group operator $e^{-iHt}$ only involves the action of the generator $H$. For quantum impurity problems, we introduce an adapted discretization scheme for the bath spectral function. We discuss the relevance of these results for matrix product state (MPS) based DMRG-type algorithms, and their use within dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). We present strong evidence that the Chebyshev recursion extracts less spectral information from $H$ than time evolution algorithms when fixing a given amount of created entanglement.},

This allows us to treat much larger bath sizes and by that reach substantially longer times (factor $\sim$ 2 -- 3) than with exact diagonalization. We show that the star geometry of the underlying impurity problem can have substantially better entanglement properties than the previously favoured chain geometry. This has immense consequences for the efficiency of an MPS-based description of general impurity problems: in the case of equilibrium DMFT, it leads to an orders-of-magnitude speedup. We introduce an approximation for the two-time hybridization function that uses time-translational invariance, which can be observed after a certain relaxation time after a quench to a time-independent Hamiltonian.},

In this work we present an extension of the Gutzwiller projection approach to treat electronic correlations below as well as above half-filling consistently. We apply this method to investigate the critical current through grain boundaries with a wide range of misalignment angles for electron- and hole-doped systems. For the latter excellent agreement with experimental data is found. We further provide a detailed comparison to an analogous weak-coupling evaluation.},

We use the Gutzwiller mean-field approximation and consider two different setups. In the first one, the expansion is restricted to one direction. We show that this leads to the emergence of two condensates with well defined momenta, and argue that such a construct can be used to create atom lasers in optical lattices. In the second setup, we study Mott insulators that are allowed to expand in all directions in the lattice. In this case, a simple condensate is seen to develop within the mean-field approximation. However, its constituent bosons are found to populate many nonzero momentum modes. An analytic understanding of both phenomena in terms of the exact dispersion relation in the hard-core limit is presented.},

Rather, it will be trapped in a prethermalized state and can thermalize only at a later stage. We discuss several examples for which this prethermalized state shares some properties with the nonthermal steady state that emerges in the corresponding integrable system. These examples support the notion that nonthermal steady states in integrable systems may be viewed as prethermalized states that never decay further. Furthermore we show that prethermalization plateaus are under certain conditions correctly predicted by generalized Gibbs ensembles, which are the appropriate extension of standard statistical mechanics in the presence of many constants of motion. This establishes that the relaxation behaviors of integrable and nearly integrable systems are continuously connected and described by the same statistical theory.},

We focus mainly on the nonequilibrium generalizations of the flow equation approach and of dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). In the nonequilibrium flow equation approach one first diagonalizes the Hamiltonian iteratively, performs the time evolution in this diagonal basis, and then transforms back to the original basis, thereby avoiding a direct perturbation expansion with errors that grow linearly in time. In nonequilibrium DMFT, on the other hand, the Hubbard model can be mapped onto a time-dependent self-consistent single-site problem. We discuss results from the flow equation approach for nonlinear transport in the Kondo model, and further applications of this method to the relaxation behavior in the ferromagnetic Kondo model and the Hubbard model after an interaction quench. For the interaction quench in the Hubbard model, we have also obtained numerical DMFT results using quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In agreement with the flow equation approach they show that for weak coupling the system relaxes to a "prethermalized" intermediate state instead of rapid thermalization. We discuss the description of nonthermal steady states with generalized Gibbs ensembles.},
