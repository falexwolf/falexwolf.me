employer_info = {Working with the founders as 1\textsuperscript{st} employee in the computing team \& 3\textsuperscript{rd} employee overall, I led the build-up \& application of the computational part of Cellarity's predictive drug discovery platform. The platform is based on targeting features learned from single-cell resolved omics data, deriving predictive capabilities across the entire drug discovery \& development process. Cellarity raised \$50M in Series A and \href{https://twitter.com/falexwolf/status/1365708441688408069}{\$123M in Series B}. I reported to founders, CDO \& CEO while the company grew from 3 to $\sim$100 employees during 3 years 9 months. Like Moderna, Cellarity was created by Flagship Pioneering. In 2021, Cellarity has ranked among the \href{https://www.fiercebiotech.com/special-report/fierce-biotech-s-2021-fierce-15-0}{top-15 Fierce Biotech} and \href{https://app.scientist.com/blog/2021/10/07/5-up-and-coming-biotech-startups-worth-watching}{top-5 Scientist.com} BioTech startups.}

activity = {Scanpy is a toolkit of data science tools that would learn from an annotated data matrix in a modular \& efficient fashion. In addition to implementation choices and the API design, the main contribution was to consolidate approaches in the field: visualization, clustering, trajectory inference, batch correction, and other tasks had typically been based off of different data representations. Scanpy implemented tool chains operating on one consistent representation.}
activity = {Co-created anndata. Introduced centering data science workflows around an initially unstructured annotated data object, designed the API, wrote tutorials and documentation until anndata v0.7, and implemented most of the early functionality, among others, reading \& writing, the on-disk format h5ad, views, sparse data support, concatenation, backed mode.}
