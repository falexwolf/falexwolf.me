Title: Buying CO2 removal to compensate for flying

*Published: 2023-02-19.*

Paul Graham [tweeted last week](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1624566028285145091): "Charm Industrial now lets you buy CO2 removal direct through an online form. You can take a flight, and after landing, pay to have the CO2 taken back out of the atmosphere."

The topic matters to me [1], so I researched material that would provide guidance on which initiatives I should trust.

In summary: In the past two years, reliable, auditable CO2 removal got scaled to thousands of tons. Since [very recently](https://web.archive.org/web/20221001000000*/https://climeworks.com/actnow), individuals can buy it through [ClimeWorks](https://climeworks.com/actnow) and [Charm Industrial](https://charmindustrial.com/buy) (and potentially others).

1. ClimeWorks and Charm Industrial are the only two companies that allow individuals to buy CO2 removal out of [Stripe Climate](https://stripe.com/en-de/climate)'s [first batch](https://github.com/stripe/carbon-removal-source-materials/tree/master/Project%20Applications/2020) in 2020. Microsoft also evaluated and funded them.
2. ClimeWorks comes out of [CarbonPlan's CDR proposal database](https://carbonplan.org/research/cdr-database) among 4 approaches estimated to provide CO2 removal beyond 1k years and at an essentially unlimited scale. A recent [CarbonPlan report](https://carbonplan.org/research/cdr-scale-barriers) found no fundamental problems with the current absence of standards, given the nascence of the field: it seems on track to become more regulated as it scales.
3. A [Grist article](https://grist.org/climate-energy/lucky-charm/) on Charm and a [Quartz article](https://qz.com/1100221/the-worlds-first-negative-emissions-plant-has-opened-in-iceland-turning-carbon-dioxide-into-stone) on ClimeWorks provide additional context. They're a bit outdated, and things have improved since then. For instance, ClimeWorks [aims to deploy a 36k tons plant in 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climeworks), running the 4k removal plant stably.
4. Mainstream press articles confirm the conclusions on a high level.

The sources seem aligned that scaling to 50 - 100 USD per ton removed CO2 equivalent could be possible over the upcoming years if the industry keeps scaling.

Until someone provides other evidence, I'll start to offset my past & future flights with ClimeWorks & Charm Industrials and watch out to support new players in this space (the Stripe & CarbonPlan pages link to many initiatives).

**Notes**

[1] Since around 2000, I've tried to live without causing climate (and nature more generally) too much damage. But flying became a problem after taking a job in Cambridge, MA, while raising kids in Munich. In 2018, I flew 3 times, in 2019, 10 times, and across 2020, 2021, and 2022, 4 times. That's 16 flights, totaling around 16 tons of CO2 (according to Google).

Hence, I had hoped for reliable (auditable) CO2 removal and only rarely clicked Lufthansa's ["CO2 offset" button](https://www.lufthansa.com/de/en/offset-flight), not having much faith in it.

To me, it's a missing piece among personal behaviors that I felt are [meaningful](https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector) and that I could rather easily and consistently accomplish:

* Devoting my career to improving renewable energies until 2015 (unfortunately, without achieving much).
* Voting for political parties that prioritize climate.
* Cycling during the week, typically taking trains for travel (within Europe).
* Not owning a car or devices beyond a laptop and phone (and basic household).
* Reducing meat consumption to around a single meal per week (around 10kg/year, mostly [non-beef, non-sheep](https://hannahritchie.com/rationalising-respiration-in-livestock-emissions/), since 2010).
* Buying local, seasonal, organic, non-packaged food most of the time. 
* Buying a wooden apartment in an area where houses are mostly made of concrete.
