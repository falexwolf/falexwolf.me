Title: Buying carbon removal to compensate for flights

*Published: 2023-02-19.*

Paul Graham [tweeted last week](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1624566028285145091): "Charm Industrial now lets you buy CO2 removal direct through an online form. You can take a flight, and after landing, pay to have the CO2 taken back out of the atmosphere."

Since around 2000 (my early teen years), I've tried to live without causing climate (and nature more generally) too much damage [1].

Just flying became a problem after taking a job offer in Cambridge, MA, while raising kids in Munich. In 2018, I flew 3 times, in 2019, 10 times, and in 2020+2021+2022, 4 times. That's 16 flights, totaling around 16 tons of CO2.

I had hoped for reliable (auditable) CO2 removal and only sometimes clicked Lufthansa's "compensate for your CO2" button, not having much faith in the positive effects of that button click (and payment). 

Paul Graham seems right. In the past 2 years, reliable, auditable carbon removal got scaled to thousands of tons CO2.

And, since [very recently](https://web.archive.org/web/20221001000000*/https://climeworks.com/actnow), it has become accessible to individuals through [ClimeWorks](https://climeworks.com/actnow) and [Charm Industrial](https://charmindustrial.com/buy), and potentially others.

I did some research to identify the research that would provide guidance on which approach and companies could be trusted. Here is the outcome:

1. ClimeWorks and Charm Industrial are the only 2 companies that allow individuals to buy CO2 removal out of [Stripe Climate](https://stripe.com/en-de/climate)'s [first batch](https://github.com/stripe/carbon-removal-source-materials/tree/master/Project%20Applications/2020). Microsoft also evaluated them thoroughly and confirmed with funding.
2. ClimeWorks came out of [CarbonPlan's CDR database](https://carbonplan.org/research/cdr-database) among 4 approaches providing CO2 removal beyond 1k years and at essentially unlimited scale. A recent [CarbonPlan report](https://carbonplan.org/research/cdr-scale-barriers) found no fundamental problems with the current absence of standards to scale CO2 removal, given the nascence of the field.
3. A [Grist article](https://grist.org/climate-energy/lucky-charm/) on Charm, and one on Quartz on [ClimeWorks](https://qz.com/1100221/the-worlds-first-negative-emissions-plant-has-opened-in-iceland-turning-carbon-dioxide-into-stone). They're a bit outdated, and things have improved since then. For instance, ClimeWorks aims to deploy a 36k tons plant in 2024, running the 4k removal plant stably.

Additional articles that I don't reference here confirm the above.

The sources seem aligned on that scaling to $50 or $100 per ton removed CO2 equivalent could be possible over the upcoming years, if that industry keeps scaling.

I'm convinced until someone provides different evidence, and I'll start to offset my past & future flights with ClimeWorks & Charm Industrials and keep watching out for new players in that space.


[1]: Things that I felt are [meaningful](https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector) and that I could rather easily and consistently accomplish since around 2000:

* Devoting my own career to improve renewable energies until 2015 (unfortunately, without achieving much).
* Voting for political parties that prioritize climate.
* Cycling during the week, typically taking trains for travels (within Europe).
* Not owning a car or devices beyond a laptop and phone (and basic household).
* Reducing meat consumption to around a single meal per week (around 10kg/year mostly [non-beef, non-sheep](https://hannahritchie.com/rationalising-respiration-in-livestock-emissions/), since 2010).
* Buying local, seasonal, organic, non-packaged food most of the time. 
* Buying a wooden apartment in an area where houses are mostly made of concrete.
